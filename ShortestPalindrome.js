/*
    Have a reversed version of the string as a variable
    Loop through S and compare the current whole string with the reversed string
        if substring of S is equal to substring of reversed (means we've found the shortest palindrome)
            -append  reverse substring from zero to i to S and then return
    Return empty string for edge case where S is an empty string
