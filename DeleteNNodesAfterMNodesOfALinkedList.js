    Main:
    Have a count variable equal to 1 at first because we're pointing at the head already
    While loop while curr is not null
        If count equals to m
            get the next node to connect this node with
            reset count back to equal 1
        else 
            increment count
        Move pointer forward
    Return head
            
    GetNextNode helper function: n, node
        - return a node that's n distance away from current node passed
